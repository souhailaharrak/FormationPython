#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
#Example
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)


#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas,
#which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)

#An output is a way for the computer to communicate with the outside world.
#A message displayed on the screen and the sound from a speaker are examples of outputs.


 

"""ðŸŒŸ inputs and outputs help machines communicate with the outside world

ðŸŒŸ the input() instruction allows the user to enter a value into your program

ðŸŒŸ the print() instruction is used to generate an output"""
